# BirdNET Games 🐦

## Why This Project Exists

Scientific data about wildlife should be accessible, engaging, and educational. The [BirdNET](https://birdnet.cornell.edu) bioacoustic monitoring network collects millions of bird observations globally, but this data often remains hidden in academic circles. These games bridge the gap between citizen science and public engagement, transforming real-time bird observations into interactive learning experiences.

By combining gameplay with authentic scientific data, we create opportunities for people to develop species recognition skills, understand biodiversity patterns, and connect with nature—whether they're in a classroom, museum, or simply scrolling on their phone.

## Who This Is For

### 🎓 Educators & Students

Transform ornithology lessons into interactive experiences. Use real-world data to teach biodiversity, species identification, and ecological patterns. Perfect for K-12 classrooms, university courses, or homeschool curricula.

### 🔬 Museums & Science Centers

Deploy as interactive installations on touch screens (mobile to 65" displays). Engage visitors with hands-on learning that connects global citizen science networks to your exhibits.

### 🐦 Birdwatchers & Nature Enthusiasts

Sharpen your species identification skills through repetition and gameplay. Learn which birds are being observed worldwide right now, and expand your knowledge of both common and rare species.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Families & Casual Learners

Enjoy nature-themed entertainment that's educational without being preachy. Play together, compete, and discover the incredible diversity of bird life on our planet.

### 💻 Developers & Tinkerers

Study how to integrate real-time scientific APIs into standalone web applications. Each game is a single HTML file—no build process, no dependencies—making them easy to understand, modify, and deploy anywhere.
